      "This example demonstrates how to find the area weighting of a cube's data points that fall within a given geometry from a shapefile. By performing an area weighting it allows us to account for data cells that only fall partially within our geometry, by determining the percentage of the cell that falls within the geometry and taking that percentage of the cell's value as it's overall contribution when we perform a mathematical operation (for example sum, average, or any function from `iris.analysis` that may be used in conjunction with `cube.collapsed`) on the values within the geometry.\n",

Clearly there are numerous cells toward the centre of the grid that entirely sit within the geometry, so the values of these cells will contribute 100% to the mathematical operation to be performed. However the top centre cell only overlaps the geometry by about 10%, so will only contribute 10% of its value, and so on."

      "An example of when this might be valuable is determining the total rainfall within a UK county over a given time period. This would be done by collapsing the cube over the time dimension and finding the sum of all the values that lie within the geometry of the county we are interested in. As in the image above, not all cells will be fully contained within the geometry but if we want to find only the rain that falls within the county's geometry then we need to find the percentage of the total rainfall for that cell that fell within the geometry. This is where this area weighting approach is beneficial."
