By performing an area weighting, this allows us to account for data cells that fall partially within our geometry, by determining the percentage coverage of a cell within this geometry.\n",

Clearly there are numerous cells toward the centre of the grid that entirely sit within the geometry, so the values of these cells will contribute 100% to the mathematical operation to be performed. However, the top centre cell only overlaps the geometry by about 10%, so will only contribute 10% of its value, and so on."

This would be done by collapsing the cube over the time dimension and finding the sum of values that lie within the geometry of the county we have interested in. As in the image above, not all cells will be fully contained within the geometry, but if we want to find only rainfall within a county's geometry then we need to find the area-weighted amount of rainfall for that cell (determine by how much overlap with the given geometry)."
