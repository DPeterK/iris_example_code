Clearly there are numerous cells toward the centre of the grid that entirely sit within the geometry, so the values of these cells will contribute 100% to the mathematical operation to be performed. However the top centre cell only overlaps the geometry by about 10%, so will only contribute 10% of its value, and so on."

This would be done by collapsing the cube over the time dimension and finding the sum of all the values that lie within the geometry of the county we are interested in. As in the image above, not all cells will be fully contained within the geometry and so in order to determine the amount of rainfall within the county's geometry, we need to find the area-weighted amount of total rainfall for that cell that fell within the geometry."
