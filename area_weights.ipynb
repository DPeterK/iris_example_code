      "This example demonstrates how to find the area weighting of a cube's data points that fall within a given geometry from a shapefile. By performing an area weighting it allows us to account for data cells that only fall partially within our geometry, by determining the percentage of the cell's area that falls within the geometry. We can use that percentage to define its overall contribution when we perform a mathematical operation on the values within the geometry (for example by using a function from `iris.analysis` that may be used in conjunction with `cube.collapsed`).\n",

      "In the image the black grid is the grid of data cells from the cube, the blue line is the extent of the shapefile geometry and the green filled area is the area of the grid that sits within the shapefile. Clearly there are numerous cells toward the centre of the grid that entirely sit within the geometry, so the values of these cells will contribute 100% to the mathematical operation to be performed. However the top centre cell only overlaps the geometry by about 10%, so will only contribute 10% of its value, and so on."

      "An example of when this might be valuable is determining the total rainfall within a UK county over a given time period. This would be done by collapsing the cube over the time dimension and finding the sum of all the values that lie within the geometry of the county we are interested in. As in the image above, not all cells will be fully contained within the geometry but if we want to find only the rain that falls within the county's geometry then we need to find the area-weighted amount of the total rainfall for that cell that fell within the geometry."
