      "Coordinate categorisation allows data within a given coordinate on a cube to be categorised, notably in terms of adding a time category, for example days of week, month or year, or season membership. Such categorisation appears as an aux coord on the cube, having the same dimensions as the time coordinate.\n",

In this example we will take the A1B-scenario climate futures data for North America, which contains 240 yearly timesteps from 1860 to 2099, and categorise this time coord first by year and then by decade. We will use the former categorisation to extract data from the cube from after the year 1980 and the latter categorisation to plot the cube's data on a series of per-decade aggregations."
