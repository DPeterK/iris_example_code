IRIS EXAMPLE CODE GUIDELINES

Iris code examples are designed to present worked examples of common requests
from the Met Office science community. These are things then that are a little
out of the ordinary and/or a little complex but frequently used within Science.

Worked examples should be in the form of an IPython notebook. This, and the
notebook converted to html, should both be added to this repo and the html
version of the notebook linked in the html landing page.

As an Iris developer supplying a new code example then, it is requested that
you observe the following guidelines.

The guidelines, then, are:
  1. Describe what is going on. Ideally there should be about as much prose
     describing code steps shown as there is code.
  2. Use sections. As much as possible, divide the worked example into sections
     that encapsulate one element of the example overall.
  3. Use pictures as appropriate. As is said, a picture paints a thousand
     words. If appropriate then, consider adding a picture to help describe a
     particularly complex point. If the worked example generates a plot,
     include it!
  4. Use sample data. The scope of these examples means it is necessary to use
     Iris sample data to demonstrate the example.
  5. Code considerations. The code should:
     a) be able to run,
     b) be Python code, as opposed to iPython notebook code (so not using any
        shortcuts available in iPython notebooks), and
     c) print versions of any software used, especially for Iris and Cartopy.
  6. These should be worked examples, NOT teaching material. As such, the code
     supplied should entirely demonstrate the point being made and exercises
     for the reader should not be used.
