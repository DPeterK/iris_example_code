      "Individual data points within Iris cubes are actually cells, which can be made up of *both* a point and a set of bounds. Cells do not have to be bounded, however in this example we are interested in cells that are.\n",

      "In a bounded cell, the point defines the precise position at which the point's value holds, while the bounds define the extent over which the point's value is *also true*.\n",

      "To conceptualise this, imagine that our cell contains one temperature field from a UKV model run. Our cell's point tells us that the value of this given cell is 300K, but our cell is also bounded. This means that our cell's value also holds across the volume described by the bounds. If the UKV model has a resolution of 1.5km and we assume this is true in x, y and z, then we state that our value of 300K is true for a cube 1.5km on a side centred on our cell's point.\n",
